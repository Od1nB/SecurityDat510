To run the servers two commands must be run to install the requirments
    pip install requests
    pip install flask

The files used for showing the DSS in "real time" is the servers on script bob.py and alice.py
These can be run and tried out on local host port 80 and 5000. Run route /getdoc on one of
the servers to test it out and see if the message is really sent Alice or Bob. 

The dssImplement.py script prints the variables throughout the DSS and shows what happens.
Run it to get all the info in the terminal.
