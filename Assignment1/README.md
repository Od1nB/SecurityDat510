Cryptanalysis of primitive ciphers

Part I
Part 1 consists of Part1.py with a bunch of different methods for the different tasks.
The tools from Task 1 can be used to try Task3, the last two methods are for Task 2

Part II 
Two files, Part2_SDES.py and app.py. The first file defines a ton of functions used for cracking the the two ciphertexts at the top of the script. The app.py is the webserver that imports the Part2_SDES.py script for help in decrypting ciphers

Requirements
python 3 to run the scripts
Flask to run the webserver

command for installing flask: pip install flask
